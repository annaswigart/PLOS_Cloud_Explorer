A survey was carried out on 434 representatives from various stakeholder groups in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia. Public attitude towards GM salmon was measured using self-developed questionnaires with seven-point Likert scales. The findings of this study have confirmed that public attitudes towards GM salmon is a complex issue and should be seen as a multi-faceted process. The most important direct predictors for the encouragement of GM salmon are the specific application-linked perceptions about religious acceptability of GM salmon followed by perceived risks and benefits, familiarity, and general promise of modern biotechnology. Encouragement of GM salmon also involves the interplay among other factors such as general concerns of biotechnology, threatening the natural order of things, the need for labeling, the need for patenting, confidence in regulation, and societal values. The research findings can serve as a database that will be useful for understanding the social construct of public attitude towards GM foods in a developing country.\n"], "author_display": ["Latifah Amin", "Md.

The present work examined whether the presence of S-MET affects the ATZ-biodegradation activity of the bioaugmentation bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP in a crop soil. S-MET concentrations were selected for their relevance in worst-case scenarios of soil contamination by a commercial formulation containing both herbicides. At concentrations representative of application of high doses of the formulation (up to 50 \u00b5g g\u22121 of soil, corresponding to a dose approximately 50\u00d7 higher than the recommended field dose (RD)), the presence of pure S-MET significantly affected neither bacteria survival (\u223c107 initial viable cells g\u22121 of soil) nor its ATZ-mineralization activity. Consistently, biodegradation experiments, in larger soil microcosms spiked with 20\u00d7 or 50\u00d7RD of the double formulation and inoculated with the bacterium, revealed ATZ to be rapidly (in up to 5 days) and extensively (>96%) removed from the soil. During the 5 days, concentration of S-MET decreased moderately to about 60% of the initial, both in inoculated and non-inoculated microcosms. Concomitantly, an accumulation of the two metabolites S-MET ethanesulfonic acid and S-MET oxanilic acid was found. Despite the dissipation of almost all the ATZ from the treated soils, the respective eluates were still highly toxic to an aquatic microalgae species, being as toxic as those from the untreated soil. We suggest that this high toxicity may be due to the S-MET and/or its metabolites remaining in the soil.\n      "], "author_display": ["Cristina A.

Introducing electrodes for microbial electricity generation to stimulate the anaerobic degradation of organic pollutants is highly promising for bioremediation. However, it is still not clear whether the degradation of PBDEs could be promoted by this strategy. In this study, we hypothesized that the degradation of PBDEs (e.g., BDE-209) would be enhanced under microbial electricity generation condition. The functional compositions and structures of microbial communities in closed-circuit microbial fuel cell (c-MFC) and open-circuit microbial fuel cell (o-MFC) systems for BDE-209 degradation were detected by a comprehensive functional gene array, GeoChip 4.0, and linked with PBDE degradations. The results indicated that distinctly different microbial community structures were formed between c-MFCs and o-MFCs, and that lower concentrations of BDE-209 and the resulting lower brominated PBDE products were detected in c-MFCs after 70-day performance. The diversity and abundance of a variety of functional genes in c-MFCs were significantly higher than those in o-MFCs. Most genes involved in chlorinated solvent reductive dechlorination, hydroxylation, methoxylation and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were highly enriched in c-MFCs and significantly positively correlated with the removal of PBDEs. Various other microbial functional genes for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycling, as well as energy transformation process, were also significantly increased in c-MFCs. Together, these results suggest that PBDE degradation could be enhanced by introducing the electrodes for microbial electricity generation and by specifically stimulating microbial functional genes.\n"], "author_display": ["Yonggang Yang", "Meiying Xu", "Zhili He", "Jun Guo", "Guoping Sun", "Jizhong Zhou"], "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 1.1195378, "title_display": "Microbial Electricity Generation Enhances Decabromodiphenyl Ether (BDE-209) Degradation", "publication_date": "2013-08-05T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070686"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 1.1195378, "publication_date": "2013-08-05T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070686/title"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 1.1195378, "publication_date": "2013-08-05T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070686/abstract"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 1.1195378, "publication_date": "2013-08-05T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070686/references"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 1.1195378, "publication_date": "2013-08-05T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070686/body"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 1.1195378, "publication_date": "2013-08-05T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070686/introduction"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 1.1195378, "publication_date": "2013-08-05T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070686/results_and_discussion"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 1.1195378, "publication_date": "2013-08-05T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070686/materials_and_methods"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 1.1195378, "publication_date": "2013-08-05T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070686/supporting_information"}, {"publication_date": "2012-10-08T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047205/abstract", "score": 1.1195378, "article_type": "Research Article"}, {"publication_date": "2012-10-08T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047205/body", "score": 1.1195378, "article_type": "Research Article"}, {"publication_date": "2012-10-08T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047205/introduction", "score": 1.1195378, "article_type": "Research Article"}, {"publication_date": "2012-10-08T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047205/results_and_discussion", "score": 1.1195378, "article_type": "Research Article"}, {"publication_date": "2012-10-08T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047205/materials_and_methods", "score": 1.1195378, "article_type": "Research Article"}, {"publication_date": "2012-10-08T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047205/supporting_information", "score": 1.1195378, "article_type": "Research Article"}, {"publication_date": "2012-10-08T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047205/title", "score": 1.1195378, "article_type": "Research Article"}, {"publication_date": "2012-10-08T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047205/references", "score": 1.1195378, "article_type": "Research Article"}, {"abstract": ["\n        Intensive use of chlorpyrifos has resulted in its ubiquitous presence as a contaminant in surface streams and soils. It is thus critically essential to develop bioremediation methods to degrade and eliminate this pollutant from environments. We present here that a new fungal strain Hu-01 with high chlorpyrifos-degradation activity was isolated and identified as Cladosporium cladosporioides based on the morphology and 5.8S rDNA gene analysis. Strain Hu-01 utilized 50 mg\u00b7L\u22121 of chlorpyrifos as the sole carbon of source, and tolerated high concentration of chlorpyrifos up to 500 mg\u00b7L\u22121. The optimum degradation conditions were determined to be 26.8\u00b0C and pH 6.5 based on the response surface methodology (RSM). Under these conditions, strain Hu-01 completely metabolized the supplemented chlorpyrifos (50 mg\u00b7L\u22121) within 5 d. During the biodegradation process, transient accumulation of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) was observed. However, this intermediate product did not accumulate in the medium and disappeared quickly. No persistent accumulative metabolite was detected by gas chromatopraphy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis at the end of experiment. Furthermore, degradation kinetics of chlorpyrifos and TCP followed the first-order model. Compared to the non-inoculated controls, the half-lives (t1/2) of chlorpyrifos and TCP significantly reduced by 688.0 and 986.9 h with the inoculum, respectively. The isolate harbors the metabolic pathway for the complete detoxification of chlorpyrifos and its hydrolysis product TCP, thus suggesting the fungus may be a promising candidate for bioremediation of chlorpyrifos-contaminated water, soil or crop.\n      "], "author_display": ["Shaohua Chen", "Chenglan Liu", "Chuyan Peng", "Hongmei Liu", "Meiying Hu", "Guohua Zhong"], "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 1.1195378, "title_display": "Biodegradation of Chlorpyrifos and Its Hydrolysis Product 3,5,6-Trichloro-2-Pyridinol by a New Fungal Strain <i>Cladosporium cladosporioides</i> Hu-01", "publication_date": "2012-10-08T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047205"}, {"abstract": ["Background: The complex characteristics and unclear biological fate of biomacromolecules (BMM), including colloidal and soluble microbial products (SMP), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and membrane surface foulants (MSF), are crucial factors that limit our understanding of membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). Findings: In this study, the microbial transformation of BMM was investigated in a lab-scale MBR by well-controlled bioassay tests. The results of experimental measurements and mathematical modeling show that SMP, EPS, and MSF had different biodegradation behaviors and kinetic models. Based on the multi-exponential G models, SMP were mainly composed of slowly biodegradable polysaccharides (PS), proteins (PN), and non-biodegradable humic substances (HS). In contrast, EPS contained a large number of readily biodegradable PN, slowly biodegradable PS and HS. MSF were dominated by slowly biodegradable PS, which had a degradation rate constant similar to that of SMP-PS, while degradation behaviors of MSF-PN and MSF-HS were much more similar to those of EPS-PN and EPS-HS, respectively. In addition, the large-molecular weight (MW) compounds (>100 kDa) in BMM were found to have a faster microbial transformation rate compared to the small-MW compounds (<5 kDa). The parallel factor (PARAFAC) modeling of three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra showed that the tryptophan-like PN were one of the major fractions in the BMM and they were more readily biodegradable than the HS. Besides microbial mineralization, humification and hydrolysis could be viewed as two important biotransformation mechanisms of large-MW compounds during the biodegradation process. Significance: The results of this work can aid in tracking the origin of membrane foulants from the perspective of the biotransformation behaviors of SMP, EPS, and MSF.

The primary contribution of the study entails applying the upper echelon theory to the initial public offering (IPO) phenomenon. Specifically, we hypothesize that the industry backgrounds of corporate executives affect the amount of capital that the firm raised in the primary stock market. We argue that the firm's future investment strategies are unobserved by the investors ex-ante and investors expect firms' investment strategies to be based on the executives' industry backgrounds. As a result, the executives' industry backgrounds influence the investors' expectations about what investment strategies the firm is likely to deploy. Furthermore, the above logic also suggests that executives of different industry backgrounds should prefer different investment strategies corresponding with demand for different amount of capital. As a result, we expect the industry backgrounds to covary with the capital raised from both the supply and demand perspectives. To test the hypotheses, we ran a reduced econometric model wherein the executives' background predicts the amount of capital raised. Regression analyses suggest that the capital raised is negatively associated with the number of senior executives with prior career experience in the healthcare and genomic sectors but positively associated with the number of senior executives with prior career experience in regulatory affairs. The results provide tentative support for the notion that investors infer corporate strategies from senior executives' industry backgrounds.\n"], "author_display": ["Jay Chok", "Jifeng Qian"], "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.98954093, "title_display": "Do Executives' Backgrounds Matter to IPO Investors?

In this study, we report on the incidence of AVB associated with intraoperative device closure of the ASD with transthoracic minimal invasion, and the outcomes of this complication in our center. Methods: Between May 2006 and January 2011, a total of 213 secundum-type ASD patients were accepted in our hospital for intraoperative and transthoracic device closure with a domestic occluder. All patients were assessed by real-time transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and electrocardiograph (ECG). Results: All patients were occluded successfully under this approach. Immediate postprocedure third-degree AVB was observed in two patients. Since heart rates were in the range of about 50 to 55 beats per minute, no intervention was needed except for close observation for one patient. Another patient who recovered sinus rhythm intermittently during the operation was fitted with a temporary pacemaker. Approximately one week following glucocorticoid treatment, the AVB resolved spontaneously in these two patients. Mobitz type II AVB occurred in three patients during the procedure. Two patients developed post-operative cardiac arrest and were rescued successfully with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. One other patient changed to Mobitz type I AVB after three days. During the follow-up period, which ranged from six months to five years, no further occurrence of AVB was found. Conclusions: Intraoperative and transthoracic device closure of secundum ASDs with domestic occluder resulted in excellent closure rate. AVB is an infrequent but serious complication during and after device closure of a secundum ASD. AVB is a complication that warrants greater attention and long-term follow-up.

Methods: We performed a retrospective comparative analysis in a series of 166 long-standing persistent AF patients treated between 2006 and 2009 with either video-assisted minimally invasive ablation (83 patients), or catheter ablations (83 patients). The catheter group was screened using a \u2018pair-matched case-control\u2019 methodology in order to select appropriate statistical comparison candidates out of 169 long-standing persistent AF patients which were potentially suitable for surgery, but have been treated with catheter approaches in order to balance major prognostic factors between the two groups.

Freshwater macroalgae from the genus Oedogonium can be grown in metal-contaminated waste water to generate biomass for bioenergy applications and concomitantly bioremediate metals. However, interactions between CO2 addition and algal growth, which can affect bioremediation, remain untested. The addition of CO2 to algal cultures in the Ash Dam Water (ADW) from a coal-fired power station increased the biomass productivity of Oedogonium sp. from 6.8 g dry weight (DW) m-2 d-1 to a maximum of 22.5 g DW m-2 d-1. The greater productivity increased the rate of bioremediation of most elements. However, over time carbon-amended cultures experienced a decline in productivity. Possible explanations include metal toxicity at low pH or essential trace element limitation as a result of competition between toxic and essential trace elements for uptake into algae. Higher productivity increased bioremediation rate and yielded more biomass for bioenergy applications, making maintenance of maximum productivity the central aim of the integrated culture model. To do so it will be necessary to resolve the mechanisms responsible for declining yields over time in carbon-amended cultures. Regardless, our data demonstrate that freshwater macroalgae are ideal candidates for bioremediation of metal-contaminated waste streams.

MSC are readily differentiated towards mature osteoblasts with well-established protocols. However, tissue engineering frequently involves three-dimensional scaffolds which (i) allow for cell adhesion in a spatial environment and (ii) meet application-specific criteria, such as stiffness, degradability and biocompatibility. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we analysed two synthetic, long-term degradable polymers for their impact on MSC-based bone tissue engineering: PLLA-co-TMC (Resomer\u00ae LT706) and poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL). Both polymers enhance the osteogenic differentiation compared to tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) as determined by Alizarin red stainings, scanning electron microscopy, PCR and whole genome expression analysis. Resomer\u00ae LT706 and PCL differ in their influence on gene expression, with Resomer\u00ae LT706 being more potent in supporting osteogenic differentiation of MSC. The major trigger on the osteogenic fate, however, is from osteogenic induction medium. Conclusion: This study demonstrates an enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MSC on Resomer\u00ae LT706 and PCL compared to TCPS.

Data sources: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register for Randomized Controlled Trials, BIOSIS and LILACS), archives of spine meetings and bibliographies of relevant articles. Study selection: We included RCTs of ACDF versus ACDA in adult patients with single-level cervical spondylosis reporting at least one of the following outcomes: functionality, neurological success, neck pain, arm pain, quality of life, surgery for adjacent level degeneration (ALD), reoperation and dysphonia/dysphagia. We used no language restrictions. We performed title and abstract screening and full text screening independently and in duplicate. Data synthesis: We used random-effects model to pool data using mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We used GRADE to evaluate the quality of evidence for each outcome. Results: Of 2804 citations, 9 articles reporting on 9 trials (1778 participants) were eligible. ACDA is associated with a clinically significant lower incidence of neurologic failure (RR \u200a=\u200a0.53, 95% CI \u200a=\u200a0.37\u20130.75, p\u200a=\u200a0.0004) and improvement in the Neck pain visual analogue scale (VAS) (MD \u200a=\u200a6.56, 95% CI \u200a=\u200a3.22\u20139.90, p\u200a=\u200a0.0001; Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) \u200a=\u200a2.5. ACDA is associated with a statistically but not clinically significant improvement in Arm pain VAS and SF-36 physical component summary. ACDA is associated with non-statistically significant higher improvement in the Neck Disability Index Score and lower incidence of ALD requiring surgery, reoperation, and dysphagia/dysphonia. Conclusions: There is no strong evidence to support the routine use of ACDA over ACDF in single-level cervical spondylosis. Current trials lack long-term data required to assess safety as well as surgery for ALD. We suggest that ACDA in patients with single level cervical spondylosis is an option although its benefits and indication over ACDF remain in question. "], "author_display": ["Aria Fallah", "Elie A.

We make a further contribution by evaluating code sharing policies, supplemental materials policies, and open access status for these 170 journals for each of 2011 and 2012. We build a predictive model of open data and code policy adoption as a function of impact factor and publisher and find higher impact journals more likely to have open data and code policies and scientific societies more likely to have open data and code policies than commercial publishers. We also find open data policies tend to lead open code policies, and we find no relationship between open data and code policies and either supplemental material policies or open access journal status. Of the journals in this study, 38% had a data policy, 22% had a code policy, and 66% had a supplemental materials policy as of June 2012. This reflects a striking one year increase of 16% in the number of data policies, a 30% increase in code policies, and a 7% increase in the number of supplemental materials policies.

The rate of PAH biodegradation is affected by environmental conditions of pH, salinity and temperature. Adaptation of the pyrene degrading bacteria, Mycobacterium gilvum PYR-GCK, to fluctuating environmental conditions during pyrene biodegrading activity was studied using the quantitative real time \u2013 Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) technique. Four aromatic ring-cleavage dioxygenase genes: phdF, phdI, pcaG and pcaH; critical to pyrene biodegradation, were studied in pH states of 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 and NaCl concentrations 0 M, 0.17 M, 0.5 M, 0.6 M, 1 M. First, we conducted a residual pyrene study using gas chromatography and flame ionization technologies. Central to a gene expression study is the use of a valid endogenous reference gene, making its determination our next approach, using the geNorm/NormFinder algorithms. Armed with a valid control gene, rpoB, we applied it to a gene expression study, using the comparative critical threshold (2\u0394\u0394CT) quantification method. The pyrene degrading activity of the strain was strongly functional in all the NaCl concentration states, with the least activity found at 1M (\u223c70% degraded after 48 hours of cultivation). The transcripts quantification of three genes backed this observation with high expression levels. The gene expression levels also revealed pH 6.5 as optimal for pyrene degradation and weak degradation activity at pH of 5.5, corroborating the residual pyrene analysis. The expression of these genes as proteins has already been studied in our laboratory using proteomics techniques and this validates our current study.\n      "], "author_display": ["Abimbola Comfort Badejo", "Adegoke Olugboyega Badejo", "Kyung Hoon Shin", "Young Gyu Chai"], "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.9795956, "title_display": "A Gene Expression Study of the Activities of Aromatic Ring-Cleavage Dioxygenases in <i>Mycobacterium gilvum</i> PYR-GCK to Changes in Salinity and pH during Pyrene Degradation", "publication_date": "2013-02-28T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0058066"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "abstract": ["\n        This article uses data from Thomson Reuters Web of Science to map and analyse the scientific landscape for synthetic biology.

We use mapping techniques to identify how synthetic biology can best be understood and the range of institutions, researchers and funding agencies involved. Debates under the Convention are likely to focus on a possible moratorium on the field release of synthetic organisms, cells or genomes. Based on the empirical evidence we propose that guidance could be provided to funding agencies to respect the letter and spirit of the Convention on Biological Diversity in making research investments. Building on the recommendations of the United States Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues we demonstrate that it is possible to promote independent and transparent monitoring of developments in synthetic biology using modern information tools. In particular, public and policy understanding and engagement with synthetic biology can be enhanced through the use of online interactive tools.

Chronic pacing studies with implantable pacemakers in large animals have led to useful models of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Unfortunately, molecular and genetic studies in these large animal models are often prohibitively expensive or not available. Conversely, the mouse is an excellent species for studying molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular disease through genetic engineering. However, the large size of available pacemakers does not lend itself to chronic pacing in mice. Here, we present the design for a novel, fully implantable wireless-powered pacemaker for mice capable of long-term (>30 days) pacing. This design is compared to a traditional battery-powered pacemaker to demonstrate critical advantages achieved through wireless inductive power transfer and control. Battery-powered and wireless-powered pacemakers were fabricated from standard electronic components in our laboratory. Mice (n\u200a=\u200a24) were implanted with endocardial, battery-powered devices (n\u200a=\u200a14) and epicardial, wireless-powered devices (n\u200a=\u200a10). Wireless-powered devices were associated with reduced implant mortality and more reliable device function compared to battery-powered devices. Eight of 14 (57.1%) mice implanted with battery-powered pacemakers died following device implantation compared to 1 of 10 (10%) mice implanted with wireless-powered pacemakers. Moreover, device function was achieved for 30 days with the wireless-powered device compared to 6 days with the battery-powered device.

It has recently been established that odor preferences are shared between humans and mice, suggesting that odor exploration behavior in mice may be used to predict the effect of odors in humans. We have previously found that mice fed diets supplemented with engineered nonbrowning potatoes (-PPO) consumed more potato than mice fed diets supplemented with wild-type potatoes (WT). This prompted us to explore a possible role of potato odor in mice preference for nonbrowning potatoes. Taking advantage of two well established neuroscience paradigms, the \u201copen field test\u201d and the \u201cnose-poking preference test\u201d, we performed experiments where mice exploration behavior was monitored in preference assays on the basis of olfaction alone. No obvious preference was observed towards -PPO or WT lines when fresh potato samples were tested. However, when oxidized samples were tested, mice consistently investigated -PPO potatoes more times and for longer periods than WT potatoes. Congruently, humans discriminated WT from -PPO samples with a considerably better performance when oxidized samples were tested than when fresh samples were tested in blind olfactory experiments. Notably, even though participants ranked all samples with an intermediate level of pleasantness, there was a general consensus that the -PPO samples had a more intense odor and also evoked the sense-impression of a familiar vegetable more often than the WT samples. Taken together, these findings suggest that our previous observations might be influenced, at least in part, by differential odors that are accentuated among the lines once oxidative deterioration takes place. Additionally, our results suggest that nonbrowning potatoes, in addition to their extended shelf life, maintain their odor quality for longer periods of time than WT potatoes. To our knowledge this is the first report on the use of an animal model applied to the sensory analysis of a transgenic crop.\n"], "author_display": ["Briardo Llorente", "Vanina Rodr\u00edguez", "Guillermo D.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of persistent CRSAB after catheter removal and initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Methods: Consecutive patients with CRSAB were prospectively included from over a 41-month period. We compared the clinical features, 40 bacterial virulence genes, and outcomes between patients with persistent CRSAB (i.e., bacteremia for >3 days after catheter removal and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy) and non-persistent CRSAB. Results: Among the 220 episodes of CRSAB, the catheter was kept in place in 17 (6%) and removed in 203 (94%) cases. In 43 (21%) of the 203 episodes, bacteremia persisted for >3 days after catheter removal and initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Methicillin resistance (Odds ratio [OR], 9.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.05\u201326.61; P<0.001), non-catheter prosthetic devices (OR, 5.37; 95% CI, 1.62\u201317.80; P\u200a=\u200a0.006), and renal failure (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.48\u20137.08; P\u200a=\u200a0.003) were independently associated with persistent CRSAB. Patients with persistent CRSAB were more like to experience complication than were those with non-persistent CRSAB (72% vs. 15%; P<0.001). Among all episodes due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus, persistent CRSAB isolates were associated with accessory gene regulator (agr) group II (P\u200a=\u200a.04), but presence of other bacterial virulence genes, distribution of vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration distribution, and frequency of vancomycin heteroresistance did not differ between the groups. Conclusions: In patients with CRSAB, bacteremia persisted in 21% of cases despite catheter removal and initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Methicillin resistance, renal failure, and non-catheter prosthetic devices were independent risk factors for persistent CRSAB, which was associated with a higher rate of complications.

Nanopod production is driven by OMV formation, and in Delftia acidovorans Cs1-4 growth on phenanthrene induces OMV/nanopod formation. While OMV production has been associated with many functions, particularly with pathogens, linkage to biodegradation has been limited to a membrane stress response to lipophilic compounds. The objectives of this study were to determine: 1.) Whether induction of nanopod formation was linked to phenanthrene metabolism or a non-specific membrane stress response, and 2.) The relative importance of OMV/nanopod formation vs. formation of the S-layer alone to phenanthrene utilization. Membrane stress response was investigated by quantifying nanopod formation following exposure to compounds that exceeded phenanthrene in membrane stress-inducing potential. Naphthalene did not induce nanopod formation, and toluene was a weak inducer compared to phenanthrene (two- vs. six-fold increase, respectively). Induction of nanopod formation by growth on phenanthrene was therefore linked to phenanthrene metabolism and not a membrane stress response. Impacts on phenanthrene biodegradation of OMV/nanopod production vs. S-layer formation were assessed with D. acidovorans Cs1-4 mutants deficient in S-layer formation or OMV/nanopod production. Both mutants had impaired growth on phenanthrene, but the loss of OMV/nanopod production was more significant than loss of the S-layer. The S-layer of D. acidovorans Cs1-4 did not affect phenanthrene uptake, and its primary role in phenanthrene biodegradation process appeared to be enabling nanopod development. Nanopods appeared to benefit phenanthrene biodegradation by enhancing cellular retention of metabolites. Collectively, these studies established that nanopod/OMV formation was an essential characteristic of the D. acidovorans Cs1-4 phenanthrene degradation process. This report thus established a new dimension in the area of biodegradation, namely, the involvement of extracellular structures as elements supporting metabolic processes underlying biodegradation.\n"], "author_display": ["Ameesha Shetty", "William J.

These computing capabilities introduce security and privacy risks, yet little is known about the prevalence of such risks within the clinical setting. Methods: We used three comprehensive, publicly available databases maintained by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate recalls and adverse events related to security and privacy risks of medical devices. Results: Review of weekly enforcement reports identified 1,845 recalls; 605 (32.8%) of these included computers, 35 (1.9%) stored patient data, and 31 (1.7%) were capable of wireless communication. Searches of databases specific to recalls and adverse events identified only one event with a specific connection to security or privacy. Software-related recalls were relatively common, and most (81.8%) mentioned the possibility of upgrades, though only half of these provided specific instructions for the update mechanism. Conclusions: Our review of recalls and adverse events from federal government databases reveals sharp inconsistencies with databases at individual providers with respect to security and privacy risks. Recalls related to software may increase security risks because of unprotected update and correction mechanisms. To detect signals of security and privacy problems that adversely affect public health, federal postmarket surveillance strategies should rethink how to effectively and efficiently collect data on security and privacy problems in devices that increasingly depend on computing systems susceptible to malware.

The financial return on their investments that is afforded by patent protection, they claim, is an incentive toward innovation and reinvestment into further R&D. But this view has been challenged in recent years. Many commentators argue that patents are stifling biomedical research, for example by preventing researchers from accessing patented materials or methods they need for their studies.

Aim: To identify the barriers and facilitators that influence participation in sports for individuals with lower limb amputation. Design: Qualitative study. Participants: Twenty six individuals with lower limb amputation, all originating from the Dutch provinces of Groningen and Drenthe, of which 13 athletes. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were used to gather information. Following thematic analysis, emerging themes were organized in three categories Technical, Social and Personal. Results: Sport was perceived as enjoyable activity that would help participants to become and stay healthy, improve the number of social contacts, reduce phantom pain and decrease daily tension. Inadequate facilities, problematic transportation, trivialization from others, poor health and lack of motivation or the lack of a sports partner were barriers commonly mentioned by non-athletes. Remarkably, while all athletes were successful prosthetic users, the majority chose to participate in sports for which prosthesis was neither required nor needed. Conclusions: Each individual with lower limb amputation needs to be counselled according to the barriers and facilitators he/she personally experiences. Athletes appeared to be more proactive in searching for a solution and also appeared less discouraged by failing. "], "author_display": ["Mihai Bragaru", "C. P. van Wilgen", "Jan H. B.

The vector selection of a novel quadripolar LV pacing lead, which was mainly developed to overcome technical issues with stimulation thresholds and phrenic nerve capture, may affect hemodynamic response, and was therefore assessed in this study. (German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00000573). Methods and Results: Hemodynamic effects of a total of 145 LVPCs (9.1 per patient) of CRT devices with a quadripolar LV lead (Quartet\u2122, St. Jude Medical) were assessed in 16/20 consecutive patients by invasive measurement of LV+dP/dtmax at an invasively optimized AV-interval in random order. Optimal (worst) LVPCs per patient were identified as those with maximal (minimal) %change in LV+dP/dtmax (%\u0394LV+dP/dtmax) as compared to a preceding baseline. LV+dP/dtmax significantly increased in all 145 LVPCs (p<0.0001 compared to baseline) with significant intraindividual differences between LVPCs (p<0.0001). Overall, CRT acutely augmented %\u0394LV+dP/dtmax by 31.3% (95% CI 24%\u201339%) in the optimal, by 21.3% (95% CI: 15%\u201327%) in the worst and by 28.2% (95% CI: 21%\u201336%) in a default distal LVPC. This resulted in an absolute additional acute increase in %\u0394LV+dP/dtmax of 10.0% (95% CI: 7%\u201313%) of the optimal when compared to the worst (p<0.0001), and of 3.1% (95% CI: 1%\u20135%) of the optimal when compared to the default distal LVPC (p<0.001). Optimal LVPCs were not programmable with a standard bipolar lead in 44% (7/16) of patients. Conclusion: The pacing configuration of a quadripolar LV lead determinates acute hemodynamic response. Pacing in the individually optimized configuration gives rise to an additional absolute 10% increase in %\u0394LV+dP/dtmax when comparing optimal and worst vectors.

The cellular phone technology transmits unprocessed raw data from the patient site DAD and receives and displays the processed image from the central site.

We explored the utility of a point-of-care device (POCD) for DSP detection by nontechnical personnel and a validation of diagnostic thresholds with those observed in a normative database. Research Design and Methods: 44 subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes underwent standard NCS (reference method). Two nontechnical examiners measured sural nerve amplitude potential (SNAP) and conduction velocity (SNCV) using the POCD. Reliability was determined by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC [2], [1]). Validity was determined by Bland-Altman analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: The 44 subjects (50% female) with mean age 56\u00b118 years had mean SNAP and SNCV of 8.0\u00b18.6 \u00b5V and 41.5\u00b18.2 m/s using standard NCS and 8.0\u00b18.2 \u00b5V and 49.9\u00b111.1 m/s using the POCD. Intrarater reproducibility ICC values were 0.97 for SNAP and 0.94 for SNCV while interrater reproducibility values were 0.83 and 0.79, respectively. Mean bias of the POCD was \u22120.1\u00b13.6 \u00b5V for SNAP and +8.4\u00b16.4 m/s for SNCV. A SNAP of \u22646 \u00b5V had 88% sensitivity and 94% specificity for identifying age-and height-standardized reference NCS values, while a SNCV of \u226448 m/s had 94% specificity and 82% sensitivity. Abnormality in one or more of these thresholds was associated with 95% sensitivity and 71% specificity for identification of DSP according to electrophysiological criteria. Conclusions: The POCD demonstrated excellent reliability and acceptable accuracy. Threshold values for DSP identification validated those of published POCD normative values. We emphasize the presence of measurement bias \u2013 particularly for SNCV \u2013 that requires adjustment of threshold values to reflect those of standard NCS. "], "author_display": ["Justin A.

Classical strain engineering approaches are usually both time-consuming and labor intensive. Here, we aim to improve E. coli performance under oxidative stress via engineering its global regulator cAMP receptor protein (CRP), which can directly or indirectly regulate redox-sensing regulators SoxR and OxyR, and other \u223c400 genes in E. coli. Error-prone PCR technique was employed to introduce modifications to CRP, and three mutants (OM1\u223cOM3) were identified with improved tolerance via H2O2 enrichment selection. The best mutant OM3 could grow in 12 mM H2O2 with the growth rate of 0.6 h\u22121, whereas the growth of wild type was completely inhibited at this H2O2 concentration. OM3 also elicited enhanced thermotolerance at 48\u00b0C as well as resistance against cumene hydroperoxide. The investigation about intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which determines cell viability, indicated that the accumulation of ROS in OM3 was always lower than in WT with or without H2O2 treatment. Genome-wide DNA microarray analysis has shown not only CRP-regulated genes have demonstrated great transcriptional level changes (up to 8.9-fold), but also RpoS- and OxyR-regulated genes (up to 7.7-fold). qRT-PCR data and enzyme activity assay suggested that catalase (katE) could be a major antioxidant enzyme in OM3 instead of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase or superoxide dismutase. To our knowledge, this is the first work on improving E. coli oxidative stress resistance by reframing its transcription machinery through its native global regulator. The positive outcome of this approach may suggest that engineering CRP can be successfully implemented as an efficient strain engineering alternative for E. coli.\n      "], "author_display": ["Souvik Basak", "Rongrong Jiang"], "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.8396534, "title_display": "Enhancing <i>E. coli</i> Tolerance towards Oxidative Stress via Engineering Its Global Regulator cAMP Receptor Protein (CRP)", "publication_date": "2012-12-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051179"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.8396534, "publication_date": "2012-12-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051179/title"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.8396534, "publication_date": "2012-12-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051179/abstract"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.8396534, "publication_date": "2012-12-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051179/references"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.8396534, "publication_date": "2012-12-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051179/body"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.8396534, "publication_date": "2012-12-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051179/introduction"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.8396534, "publication_date": "2012-12-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051179/results_and_discussion"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.8396534, "publication_date": "2012-12-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051179/materials_and_methods"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.8396534, "publication_date": "2012-12-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051179/supporting_information"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "abstract": ["\n        Miniaturization of active implantable medical devices is currently compromised by the available means for electrically powering them. Most common energy supply techniques for implants \u2013 batteries and inductive couplers \u2013 comprise bulky parts which, in most cases, are significantly larger than the circuitry they feed. Here, for overcoming such miniaturization bottleneck in the case of implants for electrical stimulation, it is proposed to make those implants act as rectifiers of high frequency bursts supplied by remote electrodes. In this way, low frequency currents will be generated locally around the implant and these low frequency currents will perform stimulation of excitable tissues whereas the high frequency currents will cause only innocuous heating. The present study numerically demonstrates that low frequency currents capable of stimulation can be produced by a miniature device behaving as a diode when high frequency currents, neither capable of thermal damage nor of stimulation, flow through the tissue where the device is implanted. Moreover, experimental evidence is provided by an in vivo proof of concept model consisting of an anesthetized earthworm in which a commercial diode was implanted.

This study provides new information to improve the environmental assessment of dsRNAs that become pesticidal through an RNAi process. Three agricultural soils differing in their physicochemical characteristics were obtained from the U.S., Illinois (IL; silt loam), Missouri (MO; loamy sand) and North Dakota (ND; clay loam), and exposed to the target dsRNA by incorporating insect-protected maize biomass and purified (in vitro-transcribed) DvSnf7 RNA into soil. The GM and control (non-GM maize) materials were added to each soil and incubated at ca. 22\u00b0C for 48 hours (h). Samples were collected at 12 time intervals during the incubation period, extracted, and analyzed using QuantiGene molecular analysis and insect bioassay methods. The DT50 (half-life) values for DvSnf7 RNA in IL, MO, and ND soils were 19, 28, and 15 h based on QuantiGene, and 18, 29, and 14 h based on insect bioassay, respectively. Furthermore, the DT90 (time to 90% degradation) values for DvSnf7 RNA in all three soils were <35 h. These results indicate that DvSnf7 RNA was degraded and biological activity was undetectable within approximately 2 days after application to soil, regardless of texture, pH, clay content and other soil differences.

The objective of the current study was to identify target species and strains from the macroalgal genus Ulva for bioremediation of land-based aquaculture facilities in Eastern Australia. We surveyed land-based aquaculture facilities and natural coastal environments across three geographic locations in Eastern Australia to determine which species of Ulva occur naturally in this region and conducted growth trials at three temperature treatments on a subset of samples from each location to determine whether local strains had superior performance under local environmental conditions. DNA barcoding using the markers ITS and tufA identified six species of Ulva, with U. ohnoi being the most common blade species and U. sp. 3 the most common filamentous species. Both species occurred at multiple land-based aquaculture facilities in Townsville and Brisbane and multiple strains of each species grew well in culture. Specific growth rates of U. ohnoi and U. sp. 3 were high (over 9% and 15% day\u22121 respectively) across temperature treatments. Within species, strains of U. ohnoi had higher growth in temperatures corresponding to local conditions, suggesting that strains may be locally adapted. However, across all temperature treatments Townsville strains had the highest growth rates (11.2\u201320.4% day\u22121) and Sydney strains had the lowest growth rates (2.5\u20138.3% day\u22121). We also found significant differences in growth between strains of U. ohnoi collected from the same geographic location, highlighting the potential to isolate and cultivate fast growing strains. In contrast, there was no clearly identifiable competitive strain of filamentous Ulva, with multiple species and strains having variable performance. The fast growth rates and broad geographical distribution of U. ohnoi make this an ideal species to target for bioremediation activities at land-based aquaculture facilities in Eastern Australia.\n"], "author_display": ["Rebecca J.

Recent advances in DNA synthesis and automated DNA assembly technologies suggest that it is now possible to construct synthetic systems of significant complexity. However, while a variety of novel genetic devices and small engineered gene networks have been successfully demonstrated, the regulatory complexity of synthetic systems that have been reported recently has somewhat plateaued due to a variety of factors, including the complexity of biology itself and the lag in our ability to design and optimize sophisticated biological circuitry. Methodology/Principal Findings: To address the gap between DNA synthesis and circuit design capabilities, we present a platform that enables synthetic biologists to express desired behavior using a convenient high-level biologically-oriented programming language, Proto. The high level specification is compiled, using a regulatory motif based mechanism, to a gene network, optimized, and then converted to a computational simulation for numerical verification. Through several example programs we illustrate the automated process of biological system design with our platform, and show that our compiler optimizations can yield significant reductions in the number of genes () and latency of the optimized engineered gene networks. Conclusions/Significance: Our platform provides a convenient and accessible tool for the automated design of sophisticated synthetic biological systems, bridging an important gap between DNA synthesis and circuit design capabilities. Our platform is user-friendly and features biologically relevant compiler optimizations, providing an important foundation for the development of sophisticated biological systems.

Interestingly, proliferation was significantly higher on non-wovens with round or trilobal fibres as compared to those with snowflake profile. Furthermore, proliferation increased in a wider, less dense network. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the MSCs aligned along the fibres and formed cellular layers spanning over the pores. 3D PVDF non-woven scaffolds support growth of MSCs, however fibre morphology and mesh size are relevant: proliferation is enhanced by round fibre cross sections and in rather wide-meshed scaffolds.\n"], "author_display": ["Anne Schellenberg", "Robin Ross", "Giulio Abagnale", "Sylvia Joussen", "Philipp Schuster", "Annahit Arshi", "Norbert Pallua", "Stefan Jockenhoevel", "Thomas Gries", "Wolfgang Wagner"], "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "title_display": "3D Non-Woven Polyvinylidene Fluoride Scaffolds: Fibre Cross Section and Texturizing Patterns Have Impact on Growth of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "publication_date": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094353"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094353/title"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094353/abstract"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094353/references"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094353/body"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094353/introduction"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094353/results_and_discussion"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094353/materials_and_methods"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094353/supporting_information"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0094353/conclusions"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Review", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2012-04-25T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035032/body"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "abstract": ["\nLaccases are versatile biocatalysts for the bioremediation of various xenobiotics, including dyes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. However, current sources of new enzymes, simple heterologous expression hosts and enzymatic information (such as the appropriateness of common screening substrates on laccase engineering) remain scarce to support efficient engineering of laccase for better \u201cgreen\u201d applications. To address the issue, this study began with cloning the laccase family of Lentinula edodes. Three laccases perfectio sensu stricto (Lcc4A, Lcc5, and Lcc7) were then expressed from Pichia pastoris, characterized and compared with the previously reported Lcc1A and Lcc1B in terms of kinetics, stability, and degradation of dyes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Lcc7 represented a novel laccase, and it exhibited both the highest catalytic efficiency (assayed with 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) [ABTS]) and thermostability. However, its performance on \u201cgreen\u201d applications surprisingly did not match the activity on the common screening substrates, namely, ABTS and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol. On the other hand, correlation analyses revealed that guaiacol is much better associated with the decolorization of multiple structurally different dyes than are the two common screening substrates. Comparison of the oxidation chemistry of guaiacol and phenolic dyes, such as azo dyes, further showed that they both involve generation of phenoxyl radicals in laccase-catalyzed oxidation. In summary, this study concluded a robust expression platform of L. edodes laccases, novel laccases, and an indicative screening substrate, guaiacol, which are all essential fundamentals for appropriately driving the engineering of laccases towards more efficient \u201cgreen\u201d applications.\n"], "author_display": ["Kin-Sing Wong", "Man-Kit Cheung", "Chun-Hang Au", "Hoi-Shan Kwan"], "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "title_display": "A Novel <i>Lentinula edodes</i> Laccase and Its Comparative Enzymology Suggest Guaiacol-Based Laccase Engineering for Bioremediation", "publication_date": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0066426"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0066426/title"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0066426/abstract"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0066426/references"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0066426/body"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0066426/introduction"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0066426/results_and_discussion"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0066426/materials_and_methods"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0066426/supporting_information"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Review", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2012-04-25T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035032/title"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Review", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2012-04-25T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035032/abstract"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Review", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2012-04-25T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035032/references"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Review", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2012-04-25T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035032/introduction"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Review", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2012-04-25T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035032/results_and_discussion"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Review", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2012-04-25T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035032/materials_and_methods"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Review", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2012-04-25T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035032/supporting_information"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "abstract": ["Background: Cervical disc arthroplasty is being used as an alternative degenerative disc disease treatment with fusion of the cervical spine in order to preserve motion. However, whether replacement arthoplasty in the spine achieves its primary patient centered objective of lowering the frequency of adjacent segment degeneration is not verified yet. Methodology: We conducted a meta-analysis according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration using databases including PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase. The inclusion criteria were: 1) Randomized, controlled study of degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine involving single segment or double segments using Cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) as controls; 2) A minimum of two-year follow-up using imaging and clinical analyses; 3) Definite diagnostic evidences for \u201cadjacent segment degeneration\u201d and \u201cadjacent segment disease\u201d; 4) At least a minimum of 30 patients per population. Two authors independently selected trials; assessed methodological quality, extracted data and the results were pooled. Results: No study has specifically compared the results of adjacent segment degenerative; Two papers describing 140 patients with 162 symptomatic cervical segment disorders and compared the rate of postoperative adjacent segment disease development between CDA and ACDF treatments, three publications describing the rate of adjacent-segment surgery including 1273 patients with symptomatic cervical segments. The result of the meta-analysis indicates that there were fewer the rate of adjacent segment disease and the rate for adjacent-segment surgery comparing CDA with ACDF, but the difference was not statistically significant.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a particular chain of collagen V on the fibrillogenesis of Sprague-Dawley rat tenocytes, as well as the efficacy of Col V siRNA engineered tenocytes for tendon tissue engineering. RNA interference gene therapy and a scaffold free tissue engineered tendon model were employed. The results showed that scaffold free tissue engineered tendon had tissue-specific tendon structure. Down regulation of collagen V \u03b11 or \u03b12 chains by siRNAs (Col5\u03b11 siRNA, Col5\u03b12 siRNA) had different effects on collagen I and decorin gene expressions. Col5\u03b11 siRNA treated tenocytes had smaller collagen fibrils with abnormal morphology; while those Col5\u03b12 siRNA treated tenocytes had the same morphology as normal tenocytes. Furthermore, it was found that tendons formed by coculture of Col5\u03b11 siRNA treated tenocytes with normal tenocytes at a proper ratio had larger collagen fibrils and relative normal contour. Conclusively, it was demonstrated that Col V siRNA engineered tenocytes improved tendon tissue regeneration. And an optimal level of collagen V is vital in regulating collagen fibrillogenesis.

We cultured three species of algae with and without nutrient addition in water that was contaminated with heavy metals from an Ash Dam associated with coal-fired power generation and tested metal uptake and bioremediation potential. All species achieved high concentrations of heavy metals (to 8% dry mass). Two key elements, V and As, reached concentrations in the biomass of 1543 mg.kg\u22121 DW and 137 mg.kg\u22121 DW. Growth rates were reduced by more than half in neat Ash Dam water than when nutrients were supplied in excess. Growth rate and bioconcentration were positively correlated for most elements, but some elements (e.g. Cd, Zn) were concentrated more when growth rates were lower, indicating the potential to tailor bioremediation depending on the pollutant. The cosmopolitan nature of the macroalgae studied, and their ability to grow and concentrate a suite of heavy metals from industrial wastes, highlights a clear benefit in the practical application of waste water bioremediation.\n      "], "author_display": ["Richard J.

This work aims to establish statistical models that allow us to predict the ankle quasi-stiffness and net mechanical work for adults walking on level ground. During the stance phase of walking, the ankle joint propels the body through three distinctive phases of nearly constant stiffness known as the quasi-stiffness of each phase. Using a generic equation for the ankle moment obtained through an inverse dynamics analysis, we identify key independent parameters needed to predict ankle quasi-stiffness and propulsive work and also the functional form of each correlation. These parameters include gait speed, ankle excursion, and subject height and weight. Based on the identified form of the correlation and key variables, we applied linear regression on experimental walking data for 216 gait trials across 26 subjects (speeds from 0.75\u20132.63 m/s) to obtain statistical models of varying complexity. The most general forms of the statistical models include all the key parameters and have an R2 of 75% to 81% in the prediction of the ankle quasi-stiffnesses and propulsive work. The most specific models include only subject height and weight and could predict the ankle quasi-stiffnesses and work for optimal walking speed with average error of 13% to 30%. We discuss how these models provide a useful framework and foundation for designing subject- and gait-specific prosthetic and exoskeletal devices designed to emulate biological ankle function during level ground walking.\n      "], "author_display": ["Kamran Shamaei", "Gregory S.

Expansins play diverse roles in plant developmental processes related to the action of cell wall loosening.

Changes in each of these amino acids enhanced chromate reductase activity of the enzyme, showing that this network is centrally involved in chromate reduction.\n      "], "author_display": ["Subramaniam Eswaramoorthy", "S\u00e9bastien Poulain", "Rainer Hienerwadel", "Nicolas Bremond", "Matthew D.

These enzymes lead the initial step of the lower catabolic pathway of aromatic hydrocarbons through the extradiol cleavage pathway and participate in the attack of PAH ring cleavage, respectively.

Silk biomaterials have come to focus due to their great mechanical properties. As untreated silkworm silk has been found to be quite immunogenic, an alternative could be spider silk. Not only does it own unique mechanical properties, its biocompatibility has been shown already in vivo. In our study, we used native spider dragline silk which is known as the strongest fibre in nature. Methodology/Principal Findings: Steel frames were originally designed and manufactured and woven with spider silk, harvesting dragline silk directly out of the animal. After sterilization, scaffolds were seeded with fibroblasts to analyse cell proliferation and adhesion. Analysis of cell morphology and actin filament alignment clearly revealed adherence. Proliferation was measured by cell count as well as determination of relative fluorescence each after 1, 2, 3, and 5 days. Cell counts for native spider silk were also compared with those for trypsin-digested spider silk. Spider silk specimens displayed less proliferation than collagen- and fibronectin-coated cover slips, enzymatic treatment reduced adhesion and proliferation rates tendentially though not significantly. Nevertheless, proliferation could be proven with high significance (p<0.01). Conclusion/Significance: Native spider silk does not require any modification to its application as a biomaterial that can rival any artificial material in terms of cell growth promoting properties. We could show adhesion mechanics on intracellular level. Additionally, proliferation kinetics were higher than in enzymatically digested controls, indicating that spider silk does not require modification. Recent findings concerning reduction of cell proliferation after exposure could not be met. As biotechnological production of the hierarchical composition of native spider silk fibres is still a challenge, our study has a pioneer role in researching cellular mechanics on native spider silk fibres.

We show that natural complexes typically engage in more polar contacts than synthetic molecules bound to proteins. The synthetic molecules also have a higher proportion of unmatched heteroatoms at the interface than the natural sets. These observations suggest that there are lessons to be learnt from Nature, which could help us to improve the characteristics of man-made molecules.

Natural resistance has so far only been reported for CMD in cassava. CBSD is caused by two virus species, Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). A sequence of the CBSV coat protein (CP) highly conserved between the two virus species was used to demonstrate that a CBSV-CP hairpin construct sufficed to generate immunity against both viral species in the cassava model cultivar (cv. 60444). Most of the transgenic lines showed high levels of resistance under increasing viral loads using a stringent top-grafting method of inoculation. No viral replication was observed in the resistant transgenic lines and they remained free of typical CBSD root symptoms 7 month post-infection. To generate transgenic cassava lines combining resistance to both CBSD and CMD the hairpin construct was transferred to a CMD-resistant farmer-preferred Nigerian landrace TME 7 (Oko-Iyawo). An adapted protocol allowed the efficient Agrobacterium-based transformation of TME 7 and the regeneration of transgenic lines with high levels of CBSV-CP hairpin-derived small RNAs. All transgenic TME 7 lines were immune to both CBSV and UCBSV infections. Further evaluation of the transgenic TME 7 lines revealed that CBSD resistance was maintained when plants were co-inoculated with East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV), a geminivirus causing CMD.

In the present study, the phytase genes phyA and appA were introduced into Brassica napus cv Westar with a signal peptide sequence and CaMV 35S promoter, respectively. Three independent transgenic lines, P3 and P11 from phyA and a18 from appA, were selected. The three transgenic lines exhibited significantly higher exuded phytase activity when compared to wild-type (WT) controls. A quartz sand culture experiment demonstrated that transgenic Brassica napus had significantly improved P uptake and plant biomass. A soil culture experiment revealed that seed yields of transgenic lines P11 and a18 increased by 20.9% and 59.9%, respectively, when compared to WT. When phytate was used as the sole P source, P accumulation in seeds increased by 20.6% and 46.9% with respect to WT in P11 and a18, respectively. The P3 line accumulated markedly more P in seeds than WT, while no significant difference was observed in seed yields when phytate was used as the sole P source. Phytase activities in transgenic canola seeds ranged from 1,138 to 1,605 U kg\u20131 seeds, while no phytase activity was detected in WT seeds. Moreover, phytic acid content in P11 and a18 seeds was significantly lower than in WT. These results introduce an opportunity for improvement of soil and seed phytate-P bioavailability through genetic manipulation of oilseed rape, thereby increasing plant production and P nutrition for monogastric animals.\n      "], "author_display": ["Yi Wang", "Xiangsheng Ye", "Guangda Ding", "Fangsen Xu"], "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "title_display": "Overexpression of <i>phyA</i> and <i>appA</i> Genes Improves Soil Organic Phosphorus Utilisation and Seed Phytase Activity in <i>Brassica napus</i>", "publication_date": "2013-04-03T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0060801"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-04-03T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0060801/title"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-04-03T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0060801/abstract"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-04-03T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0060801/references"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-04-03T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0060801/results_and_discussion"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-04-03T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0060801/materials_and_methods"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-04-03T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0060801/body"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2013-04-03T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0060801/introduction"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "article_type": "Research Article", "score": 0.7916328, "publication_date": "2011-12-29T00:00:00Z", "eissn": "1932-6203", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0029491/supporting_information"}, {"journal": "PLoS ONE", "abstract": ["\n        The aim of this study was to isolate and identify marine-derived bacteria which exhibited high tolerance to, and an ability to biodegrade, 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquids.

This study assesses the behaviour of a new composite mesh by comparing it with two latest-generation composites currently used in clinical practice. Methods: Defects (7x5cm) created in the anterior abdominal wall of New Zealand White rabbits were repaired using a polypropylene mesh and the composites: PhysiomeshTM; VentralightTM and a new composite mesh with a three-dimensional macroporous polyester structure and an oxidized collagen/chitosan barrier. Animals were sacrificed on days 14 and 90 postimplant. Specimens were processed to determine host tissue incorporation, gene/protein expression of neo-collagens (RT-PCR/immunofluorescence), macrophage response (RAM-11-immunolabelling) and biomechanical resistance. On postoperative days 7/14, each animal was examined laparoscopically to quantify adhesions between the visceral peritoneum and implant. Results: The new composite mesh showed the lowest incidence of seroma in the short term. At each time point, the mesh surface covered with adhesions was greater in controls than composites. By day 14, the implants were fully infiltrated by a loose connective tissue that became denser over time. At 90 days, the peritoneal mesh surface was lined with a stable mesothelium. The new composite mesh induced more rapid tissue maturation than PhysiomeshTM, giving rise to a neoformed tissue containing more type I collagen. In VentralightTM the macrophage reaction was intense and significantly greater than the other composites at both follow-up times. Tensile strengths were similar for each biomaterial. Conclusions: All composites showed optimal peritoneal behaviour, inducing good peritoneal regeneration and scarce postoperative adhesion formation. A greater foreign body reaction was observed for VentralightTM. All composites induced good collagen deposition accompanied by optimal tensile strength. The three-dimensional macroporous structure of the new composite mesh may promote rapid tissue regeneration within the mesh.

In the present study, the binding modes of lignin to Lac, LiP and MnP were systematically determined, respectively. Robustness of these modes was further verified by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Residues GLU460, PRO346 and SER113 in Lac, residues ARG43, ALA180 and ASP183 in LiP and residues ARG42, HIS173 and ARG177 in MnP were most crucial in binding of lignin, respectively. Interactional analyses showed hydrophobic contacts were most abundant, playing an important role in the determination of substrate specificity.

Methods: Negative binomial interrupted time series analysis using practice level prescribing data from April 2007 to March 2012. The main outcome measure was the prescribing rate of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), including hormonal and non hormonal intrauterine devices and systems (IUDs and IUSs), injectable contraceptives and hormonal implants. Results: Prescribing rates of Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) were stable before the introduction of contraceptive targets to the QOF and increased afterwards by 4% annually (rate ratios \u200a=\u200a1.04, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.03, 1.06). The increase in LARC prescribing was mainly driven by increases in injectables (increased by 6% annually), which was the most commonly prescribed LARC method. Of other types of LARC, the QOF indicator was associated with a step increase of 20% in implant prescribing (RR\u200a=\u200a 1.20, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a 1.09, 1.32). This change is equivalent to an additional 110 thousand women being prescribed with LARC had QOF points not been introduced. Conclusions: Pay for performance incentives for contraceptive counselling in primary care with women seeking contraceptive advice has increased uptake of LARC methods. "], "author_display": ["Myat E.
